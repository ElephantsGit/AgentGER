PROMPT_TEMPLATE_WITH_IMPROVEMENT = '''You are a professional expert in figure-summary evaluation, skilled at conducting strict five-dimension evaluations based on multimodal input (image + text).

Based on the input "figure image" and "original summary,"
you must evaluate the summary along the following five dimensions with a strict 0/1/2 scoring scheme, and provide reasons. Last Please generate an improved summary that addresses the weaknesses identified in the feedback, especially focusing on dimensions that scored below 2. Make sure to:
- Fix any factual inaccuracies (Faithfulness)
- Add missing key information (Comprehensiveness)
- Ensure concise expression (Conciseness)
- Maintain logical flow (Logical Consistency)
- Use professional terminology (Professional Relevance)

---

[Scoring Dimension Definitions]
1. Faithfulness:  
   Ensure the summary strictly adheres to the figure's facts, including values, trends, proportions, and labels; no fabrication, distortion, or misinterpretation.  
   - 0: The summary severely deviates from the figure's facts, with errors or fabricated content.  
   - 1: Largely consistent with the figure, but with partial deviations or inaccurate details.  
   - 2: Fully faithful to the figure's facts, with all information correct.

2. Completeness:  
   Check whether the summary covers core elements, main trends, and key comparisons in the figure.  
   - 0: Misses major content or key information.  
   - 1: Covers the main information but with secondary omissions.  
   - 2: Fully covers all key information.

3. Conciseness:  
   Check whether the summary is compact, information-dense, and free of redundancy.  
   - 0: Redundant, or overly brief to the point of missing key information.  
   - 1: Generally concise but can be further optimized.  
   - 2: Tersely written with efficient expression.

4. Logicality:  
   Check whether the logic is coherent, sequence is reasonable, and causal relations are clear.  
   - 0: Logical confusion or self-contradiction.  
   - 1: Basically coherent but with slight jumps or ambiguity.  
   - 2: Clear logic and strong consistency.

5. Analysis:  
   Check whether the summary meets domain-standard expression (e.g., finance, statistics, economics).  
   - 0: Lacks professionalism, or uses incorrect terminology/units.  
   - 1: Professional expression is insufficient or slightly colloquial.  
   - 2: Accurate terminology, formal tone, and analytical depth.

[Output Requirements]
1. You must output standardized JSON inside `<evaluation>` tags, with the following structure:

<evaluation>
{{"scores": {{"faithfulness": 0-2, "completeness": 0-2, "conciseness": 0-2, "logicality": 0-2, "analysis": 0-2}}, "reasons": {{"faithfulness": "brief explanation", "completeness": "brief explanation", "conciseness": "brief explanation", "logicality": "brief explanation", "analysis": "brief explanation"}}}}
</evaluation>
<modification>
{{"improved_summary": "new summary"}}
</modification>

2. The JSON must be valid, single-line JSON.  
3. The output format must include `<evaluation>` tags containing scores, reasons, and weights, followed by `<modification>` tags containing the improved_summary.'''
